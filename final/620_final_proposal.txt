For our final project, we will look at two sources of data from the New York Times, both from their “Best Books of the 21st Century” series. The first source will be the article announcing the 100 winners. The article includes a blurb about each of the books. The second source will be this article revealing the full ballots of 51 authors, actors, musicians, and poets (from among the “hundreds of literary luminaries” the Times says they polled). We are curious to know if the books highlighted in the full ballots article are representative of the top performing books, and also we would like to investigate what patterns or ‘cliques’ emerge between the books recommended by the “literary luminaries” (such as genre or generation). We’re also curious to see what patterns emerge from performing sentiment analysis on the blurbs provided by the New York Times for each of the books from the winners list.

We plan to use network analysis to investigate the relationship between the literary luminaries, either using a bipartite graph with one node set being the luminaries and the other being the books, or by using the authors of each book as nodes with edges representing one author’s recommendation of another’s book. We will also use sentiment analysis to evaluate the blurb provided by the New York Times for each of the books to see if any patterns emerge from the list. Some potential complications that we foresee are how to account for authors who voted for their own books, and how to account for books with multiple authors. How we choose to resolve this will depend on which direction our analysis takes us.

The group members for this project are Molly Siebecker and Marley Myrianthopoulos. Molly located, exported, and uploaded the original data. Marley maintains the team GitHub repository. Since there are only two of us, we will collaborate on each section of the project.
